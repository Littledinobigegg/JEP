This is just a github so I can look back at older versions, this is also not the offical git, the link to that is https://github.com/PlagueVonKarma/jep-hack this is a base for me to work on Johto decomp work, please feel free to use anything in here with proper credit to the respective creators. Thank you Plague Von Karma and everyone else involved with KEP and JEP for this base

The following is the readme for the offical git

Johto Expansion Pak

This is a ROM Hack of Pokemon Crystal, playing upon the Kanto Expansion Pak's old philosophy. It adds Johto- and Kanto-related Pokemon to Crystal, more interesting locations, and QoL changes.

If playing on an emulator, BGB is strongly recommended for its accuracy and features. Inaccurate emulators, such as VBA and TGB Dual, can experience unintended glitches. This hack is fully playable on official hardware as well.
New Pokemon

Using the Kanto Expansion Pak's original criteria, the ethos of the Johto Expansion Pak will be to add every "Johto- and Kanto-related Pokemon to Crystal without fundamentally changing the way the game is played."

What falls under "Johto- and Kanto-related" is a Pokemon is the following, so long as they are, in fact, related:

    Is a regional variant (Eg. Hisuian Sneasel)
    Evolves from or into a Pokemon (eg. Tangrowth, Honchkrow)
    Was cut from the final game (eg. Bellignan, Tricules, Phandarin; "beta" Pokemon)
        Or from a future title and was related to a Kanto/Johto Pokemon (eg. Lizargun/Charmada)
    Is a Paradox equivalent (eg. Walking Wake)
    Would qualify for the Kanto Expansion Pak (eg. Omegadge, Melmetal)

Any Pokemon that you can think of that would come under this, is absolutely in. Dex total is 466!

With respect to Pokemon from the May 1998 Sprite Cache, creative liberties based on their designs are taken. Given the lack of...anything for these Pokemon, they're heavily customised. Similar philosophies to the Kanto Expansion Pak's RG Asset Leak Pokemon are used.

Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, etc, are not in active consideration.
Changes

    There is now an enby character option named Topaz, purple-themed.
    You can now name your mother, just as it was in Gold and Silver's prototype stages!
    There is a new Nihon region, based on the 1998 version before it got scrapped for Johto.
    The Fairy-type is now available, though Pokemon are not retroactively changed, per the Kanto Expansion Pak philosophy (you wouldn't want a Fairy-type Granbull pre-split, would you?)
    Fossil revival is back in town! Get fossils using Rock Smash and revive them at Ruins of Alph or the newly-added Pewter Museum of Science!
    Breakable rocks now give useful items...
        1% MAX_REVIVE
        2% DOME_FOSSIL - Kabuto
        2% HELIX_FOSSIL - Omanyte
        2% WING_FOSSIL - Feradactyl
        2% OLD_AMBER - Decilla
        2% CLUB_FOSSIL - Xylodon
        4% STAR_PIECE
        10% BIG_PEARL
        18% ETHER
        24% HARD_STONE
        24% SOFT_SAND
        48% PEARL
        64% BRICK_PIECE
    Many new Trainer classes, including;
        RBY classes not in GSC, such as the Rocker, Channeler, and even the beta Firefighter
        Prototype GSC classes such as the Male Teacher, Sportsman, and Soldier
        The Painter from FRLG!
        The Elder from HGSS, featuring the NTSC Sage sprite.
        Decensor is applied to the Fisher, Beauty, Female Swimmer, Medium, and Sage sprites, to match the Japanese version. Let Tully have a puff!
    Many evolution stones have been added to accomodate the Pokemon featured here, including the Heart and Poison Stones from the SpaceWorld demo, and the Peat Block!
    The Fairy Feather from Scarlet and Violet has been added to accomodate the Fairy type.
    The Antique Pot has been added to accomodate a Shuckle evolution!
    New Club and Wing Fossils; the former for Xylodon, a May98 Prototype Pokemon, and the latter for Feradactyl, (seemingly) an Aerodactyl pre-evolution from the same prototype.
    The unused Honey Pot from prototype GSC has been added! 2 days after placing Sweet Honey, you can encounter either Munchlax, Beedrill, Ursaring, or Heracross!

QoL Changes

    A Trader NPC is available in a new Lake of Rage town area, allowing you to access trade evolutions natively.
    Kurt now makes Apricorn Balls instantly. He's had his coffee and is listening to his favourite music.
    Instant text is now an option!
    Clock reset procedure is now like vanilla GS, requiring just Down + B.
    Tilesets now handle up to 255 titles (from 192), allowing for slightly nicer maps.
    Can now have up to 17 object events.
    Gen 6 Experience System!
    Poke Balls now all have unique palettes.
    The high friendship evolution threshold is now 170, making Friend Balls sufficient for instant evolution and hatching from Eggs takes minimal effort.
    Items previously only obtainable via the Time Capsule are now distributed to specific Pokemon (5%: Polkadot Bow Snubbull, TwistedSpoon Kadabra, Metal Powder Ditto/Mimmeo, Light Ball Pikachu; 50%: Lucky Punch Chansey)
    During the intro, when knowing the PokeGear instructions, you now immediately skip some of the text relating to it, making starting the game slightly less agonising.

Map Changes

Numerous new maps are available, featuring new locations, the iconic Sevii Islands, and the Nihon region!

Additionally, there have been many wild encounter tweaks. View this document for details. (will link when hack is in a playable state)

    Johto wild encounters have been changed to be more weighted towards Johto Pokemon; eg. Murkrow is available about Ecruteak at night, Misdreavus largely replaces Gastly, etc. Levels have been adjusted.
    Kanto wild encounters have generally higher levels to aid in improving the level curve.
    Rock Smash now has variable and larger wild data, featuring rare, location-based Pokemon (eg. Corsola on the shore), and level adjustments to make them more appropriate.
    Viridian Forest has been restored.
    The Pewter Museum of Science has been restored.
    Cerulean Cave has been restored, complete with a Mewtwo fight!
    The Kanto Safari Zone map from the prototype has been restored.
    The prototype Lake of Rage village has been restored, complete with an Evolution Stone shop and Trader NPC! In general, it's themed around Pokemon evolution.
    The Pokemon Communications Centre from JP GSC has been added and tweaked into a Regional Variant Trade hub, increasing with badge count.
        The GS Ball event has been restored, now being obtainable after beating the Elite Four and trying to exit the building.
        The Egg Ticket and Eon Mail events have been restored, now being associated with Buena's Password. Redeeming the Egg Ticket gives you an Odd Egg with the usual Pokemon pool and Shiny chances; this is soft resettable if you like that sort of thing.
        Additionally, old lore relating to the area has now been restored, including something about the Unown!

16-bit index expansion for Crystal

This repository contains a modified Pokémon Crystal game, updated to handle 16-bit indexes. The main goal of this project is to create a reusable system that ROM hacks can use to bring 16-bit indexes into their games.
It is not within scope to create a new game, or to add additional features beyond 16-bit indexes.

The master branch of this repository is intended to perform identically to the original Pokémon Crystal, with minimal changes to support further development on it. Other branches will implement more features on top of it; the intention is that the necessary changes can be readily seen by comparing said branches to master (or between each other). Therefore, these other branches will never be merged into master, even though they will always be directly descended from it (i.e., in Git terminology, a merge would be a fast-forward).

Since this repository is intended to be used as a reference, the commit history is intentionally kept clean to make changes clearly visible. Therefore, modifications (such as bug fixes) will often be merged into whichever commit is more suitable for them, with the remainder of the commit tree rebased on top of the updated commit. Please do not fork this repository to build a new game on top (unless you intend to contribute to it), as the publicly-visible history will be repeatedly rewritten, making merges impossible. If you do want to contribute to the repository, let me know in advance so I can notify you of history rewrites.

For further documentation, check out the wiki.
Branches

    master: (status: stable, last update: 2023-07-18) Base branch. This branch contains a slightly modified version of Pokémon Crystal, with some quality-of-life improvements intended to make development easier. These improvements have been taken from the documentation in the main disassembly repository. This branch contains no 16-bit features and it is only intended as a reference.
    base-components: (status: stable, last update: 2023-07-18) This branch defines the basic components that will comprise the 16-bit index table system, on top of which the remaining branches will be built. Since it only defines macros (and a handful of WRAM locations to be shared by all index tables), it should build the same ROM as master.
    expand-mon-ID: (status: stable, last update: 2023-07-18) This branch implements 16-bit indexes for Pokémon species, thus allowing more than 253 species to be included in a single game.
    expand-move-ID: (status: stable, last update: 2023-07-18) This branch implements 16-bit indexes for moves, on top of the existing 16-bit support for Pokémon species from the previous branch. (Interaction between the branches is kept to a minimum, though.)
    newbox: (status: experimental, last update: 2023-07-18) This branch ports Rangi & FIQ's "newbox" from Polished Crystal. Newbox is a complete overhaul to Bill's PC, and this branch ports the functionality on top of the previous branches.
    pokecrystal: (status: N/A, last update 2023-07-18) This branch contains pret's vanilla pokecrystal and should only be used to compare with the previous branches to view pokecrystal16 changes. DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH!

FAQs

Q1: Will this engine include <insert additional feature here>?
A1: Unless the feature is specifically related to 16-bit indexing (or otherwise extending the range of possible index values), the answer is almost certainly "no". This repository's scope is limited to 16-bit indexes. If you already have a ROM hack that includes the features you like and you'd want it to have 16-bit indexes, the right course of action would be to port this engine to it. Otherwise, you can use this engine as a base to make your own ROM hack with all the features you want.

Q2: Can I use this engine for my own ROM hack?
A2: Of course; that's what it was made for. I will try make it as easy as possible to port to existing or new ROM hacks; instructions to do so will be in the wiki. All I can ask you for is that, just like this engine was openly available for you to use, you make your hack's code openly available as well — quoting some of the text in SQLite's copyright disclaimer, "may you share freely, never taking more than you give".

Q3: What's this engine's new limit on indexes?
A3: The theoretical limit is 65,534, minus a couple of "special" indexes used by the game for specific purposes (such as the value that indicates that a Pokémon is inside an egg). However, there are several limitations that will probably prevent you from ever reaching that limit. For starters, you can't fit 65,534 of anything inside a ROM bank! The index work is done, and I'll try to remove any hurdles that would render that work useless; however, if you want to push the limits of the hardware and add 20,000 new Pokémon, you'll find yourself against a technical challenge that will go beyond indexes.such as the value that indicates that a Pokémon is inside an egg).
