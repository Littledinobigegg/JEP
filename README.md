# Johto expansion pak is a literal expansion pak to Johto, it is a sequel to Kanto expansion pak a modification of RBY aiming to add onto the metagame by introducing new evolutions and forms to Kanto mons and restoring cut mons, JEP expands on this by introducing these changes for Johto. My goal with JEP is to make a romhack containing all JEP mons
